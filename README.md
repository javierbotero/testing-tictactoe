**Tic Tac Toe**

This project is a game built with javascript. The "Tic Tac Toe" game involves two players who play at intervals by placing a tile on a board that has 9 spaces. There is a winner when the player has his tile on 3 spaces in either the diagonal, horizontal or vertical positions. There is a draw where there is no winner.
